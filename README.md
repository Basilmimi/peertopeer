peer to peer clients tracker sample
Simple case for Python Peer to Peer model clients and a tracker to keep track of clients . The tracker keeps the data about the files available. The files are divided into chunks and these chunks are distributed on many different clients. The tracker keeps information about a file, it's name, chunks and where these chunks are, i.e., which peer has a chunk. The peers communicate with the tracker requesting information about a file. Then they receive the information about that file, number of chunks and locations of these chunks. The peers will connect with the other peers at which the chunks are stored; each peer will request the chunk(s) that are available on each of the other peers. Finally, the requesting peer will combine the chunks in order to form the whole file.
